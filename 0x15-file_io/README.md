# C - File I/O
In this project, I learned about the three standard file descriptors
and their `POSIX` names as well as the difference between function and system calls.
I practiced using the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write
and the flags `O_CREAT`, `O_EXCL`, `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, and `O_RDWR`
to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.
